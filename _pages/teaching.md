Who I am as a teacher is a direct result of who I am as a learner. I adopt a participatory, student-centered approach to teaching and learning as I consider this method to be an effective way of maximizing the creative potential of students. To this end, I employ dialogic teaching where I situate myself as a learner-cum-facilitator who models active listening and engagement. I also take a critical approach to curriculum development that underscores commitment to diversity in teaching, assessment and student support.

I strongly believe in multiperspectivity because when people see beyond their own experiences they can begin to understand the complex framework in which education exists. My teaching philosophy is informed by the reflective judgement model (King & Kitchener 1994) and is grounded in the core principles of **reciprocity**, **relevance** and **value-addedness**. My aim is to guide my students to learn how to learn by evaluating and synthesizing various bodies of knowledge.

I am experienced in curriculum planning as well as designing and delivering linguistics, English language and communication studies courses across a range of academic levels. The following is a list of the modules I teach/have taught, categorized by institution:
