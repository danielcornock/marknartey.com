## Research Overview

I am Assistant Professor of Discourse Studies in the Department of English at Lingnan University, Hong Kong[](https://courses.uwe.ac.uk/QQ3C/english-language-and-linguistics). I am an interdisciplinary scholar who investigates how people deploy language in specific spatiotemporal and sociocultural contexts to achieve various aims, including but not limited to identity construction or negotiation, self-promotion, argumentation, othering, resistance, and (de)legitimation. I am particularly interested in language and identities, language and inequities, language and diversity, language and ethnicity, language and race, language and gender, language and social justice,  language and/in the media, and language and/in politics.

My research has a critical orientation and an emancipatory objective. Hence, it sheds light on complex social issues in our rapidly changing world (e.g., decolonization, migration, race, gender, nationalism, social stratification), and illustrates how research on language use can translate into social transformation. My research also contributes to a perceptive understanding of our lived experience by describing how people make sense of their circumstances and happenings in their society as well as find meaning and purpose in our contemporary world. My published work draws heavily on comparative and interdisciplinary research frameworks and examines intercultural and sociocultural phenomena in Africa, Asia, Europe, the Caribbean, and North America.
