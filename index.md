## Qualifications

* Ph.D. in Discourse Studies, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong
* M.Phil. in Linguistics, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Norway
* B.A. in English Language and Linguistics (First Class Honors), University of Cape Coast, Ghana

## Research Overview

I hold The Hong Kong Polytechnic University Distinguished Postdoctoral Fellowship in the [Department of English](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/engl/) and I am a member of the [Research Center for Professional Communication in English (RCPCE)](http://rcpce.engl.polyu.edu.hk/rcpce/). I am an interdisciplinary scholar who specializes in corpus-assisted discourse studies, with a focus on issues at the intersection of language, culture and society. I am interested in how people deploy language in specific contexts to achieve various aims, including identity construction and negotiation, self-promotion and othering as well as argumentation and resistance.

The main analytic and/or theoretical frameworks I adopt are critical discourse analysis, critical metaphor analysis and discourse-mythological analysis, combining them with corpus methods and insights from history, communication studies and political science. My published work has drawn heavily on comparative and interdisciplinary research frameworks, with some exploring phenomena in Ghana, China, the US and the UK. I have published extensively in (applied) linguistics; my recent papers have appeared in journals such as *Corpora*, *World Englishes*, *Language and Intercultural Communication*, *Critical Discourse Studies* and *Discourse & Communication*, among others.
