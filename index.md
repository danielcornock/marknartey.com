## Research Overview

I am a Senior Lecturer in [English Language and Linguistics](https://courses.uwe.ac.uk/QQ3C/english-language-and-linguistics) at the University of the West of England, where I am also a member of the [Bristol Centre for Linguistics](https://www.uwe.ac.uk/research/centres-and-groups/bcl). I am an interdisciplinary scholar who investigates how people deploy language in specific spatiotemporal and sociocultural contexts to achieve various aims, including but not limited to identity construction or negotiation, self-promotion, argumentation, othering, resistance, and (de)legitimation. I am particularly interested in language and identities, language and inequities, language and diversity, language and ethnicity, language and race, language and gender, language and social justice,  language and/in the media, and language and/in politics.

My research has a critical orientation and an emancipatory objective. Hence, it sheds light on complex social issues (e.g., decolonization, migration, race, gender, nationalism, social stratification) in our rapidly changing world, and illustrates how research on language use can translate into social transformation. My published work draws heavily on comparative and interdisciplinary research frameworks and examines sociocultural and intercultural phenomena in Africa, Asia, Europe, the Caribbean, and North America.
