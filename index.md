## Research Overview

I am a Lecturer in [English Language and Linguistics](https://courses.uwe.ac.uk/QQ3C/english-language-and-linguistics) at the University of the West of England, where I am also a member of the [Bristol Centre for Linguistics](https://www.uwe.ac.uk/research/centres-and-groups/bcl). I am an interdisciplinary scholar who investigates how people deploy language in specific spatiotemporal and sociocultural contexts to achieve various aims, including but not limited to identity construction or negotiation, self-promotion, argumentation, othering, resistance and (de)legitimation. I am particularly interested in language and identity, language attitudes and stereotypes, language and diversity, language and the media and language and/in politics. 

The main analytical approaches I adopt are (critical) discourse analysis, critical metaphor analysis and discourse-mythological analysis, combining them with corpus methods and insights from history, communication studies and political science. My research has a critical orientation and an emancipatory agenda. Hence, it aims to raise awareness about various complicated social constructs and to illustrate how research on language use can translate into social transformation. My published work draws heavily on comparative and interdisciplinary research frameworks, with some exploring phenomena in Africa, Asia, Europe, South America and North America.
